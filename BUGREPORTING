Quick steps for the impatient
-----------------------------

First make sure you are running the latest version (check also
http://oer.equnet.org/testing). If so, then

./configure --enable-debug
make install
./oer -c

oer will now show debug messages on the screen. If your problem isn't
solved, read on.

First and most important
------------------------

Always get the latest version of oer (released or in testing) and see
if it works for you. If not, read on.

There are total of 3 bug type categories, the procedure depends on
what kind of bug you are dealing with. With all bug types you should
always append the following information to E-mails:

- oer version (info command while oer is running)
- Operating system type & version (type "uname -a" in console)
- Compiler type & version (type "gcc -v" or "cc -V" in console)
- Cygwin version (+ library versions) if you are running oer
  under Cygwin

Archive, configure, compilation & installation bugs
---------------------------------------------------

If there is something wrong with the archive, send an E-mail to
equ@equnet.org with subject "oer bug report: archive". In the message
part describe the problem in detail.

If you think you have found a problem with "configure" send an E-mail
to equ@equnet.org with subject "oer bug report: configure" and attach
the console output of "./configure", config.log and config.status into
the E-mail.

If there is a compiling warning or error send an E-mail to
equ@equnet.org with subject "oer bug report: compilation" and attach
the console output into the E-mail.

If there is a problem with the installation ("make install") send an
E-mail to equ@equnet.org with subject "oer bug report: installation"
and attach the console output into the E-mail.

Operational bug
---------------

If you think that oer missbehaves in some way but doesn't crash, run
configure with "./configure --enable-debug". Then start oer with
"./oer -c -d 8 -o". Make oer quit and verify that it did. Then send
the oer-<pid>.output via E-mail to equ@equnet.org with the subject
"oer bug report: operational".

Fatal bug
---------

If oer terminates unexpectedly ("crashes") proceed as follows.  First
off, configure oer with the following options:

"./configure --enable-debug"

and compile. Then make sure that your command shell allows core dumps:

limit coredumpsize 10000 (bash)
ulimit -c 10000          (csh/tcsh)

Then start oer with "./oer -c -d 8 -o". After oer "crashes" start gdb
by writing "gdb oer core" and then get a backtrace by writing "bt".
Send both, the oer-<pid>.output and the backtrace from console to
equ@equnet.org with the subject "oer bug report: fatal".

Other types of bugs
------------------- 

If the bug or problem you are dealing with doesn't belong to any of
the above bug categories, send an E-mail to equ@equnet.org with
subject "oer bug report: unknown" and describe the bug or problem in
detail.

        Thank you in advance
