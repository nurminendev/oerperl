------

- The PART message has changed in ircu (the Undernet ircd)
  and it's derivatives (which include for example the ircd

  is a fix for it
  (Thanks must go to Emperor)

  nick was on channel before issuing the MODE, fixed

1.0-62
------

- Implemented additional checks to file I/O, zero size
  configuration files in the case of disk/quota getting full
  should no longer happen
  (Thanks must go to Jarkko Torppa)
- A major oversight happened in -60 when I rewrote the

  nicks, was the only thing a friend wasn't allowed to do
  (Thanks must go to Renzo)

1.0-60
------

- Added command line parameter -l to enable a alternative
  directory for logging purposes (last/seen, raw and output)
- Added a timer to adverts just like with on join quotes,
  adverts on a busy channel were sent to each person that
  joined the channel, everytime (would cause "Target changing
  too fast" errors on heavy loaded bots and lead to adverts
  dissapearing)
- Added a chaninfo command (has also "s" chanflag support)
- sstats should now report correctly the IRC server name even
  if connecting to a Round Robin hostname
- Made a change in order for oer to become more compatible
  with oz.org (hopefully they fix the way they use ERR_BADPING)
- oer will from now on delete all not yet executed but
  scheduled MODEs for any nick that leaves a channel for any
  reason before the MODEs in question get executed
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- From now on when oer detects a nick change oer will
  re-target all pending MODEs for that nick to the new nick
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- There was a major oversight in how oer sometimes parsed
  multi MODEs sent by the IRC server, fixed
  (Thanks Renzo)
- Permbans weren't always synced after multi MODEs, fixed
- oer refused to ban itself on a channel even if chanflag "b"
  wasn't set, fixed
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- oer will now detect if Q leaves the network and will re-auth
  itself once Q re-joins the network
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- Implemented the first batch of type/value checking of user
  input values
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- Rewrote most of the authentication checks in parse.c because
  many commands were simply broken, I hope I didn't break too
  much while doing so
  (Thanks Renzo)
- oer will now assume that users with +o also have +v and
  check for +v if a +o user should loose their +o (oer wasn't
  seeing +v on users which had +o)
  (Thanks must go to Mauri Kinnunen)
- Removed some extra/non-necessary checks from parse.c
- Added a queuestats command (has also "s" chanflag support)
- From now on some basic network related error messages are
  always linked in (and shown) regardless if you specify
  --enable-debug or not

1.0-59
------

- Removed the check for +m in flood protection (at least
  QuakeNet lets a +v user talk even if banned)
- Unban didn't unban +o users, fixed
- oer allowed auto rejoin & part rejoin banvars to be 0
  even if chanflag "r" was set, fixed
- Added del chanmode command
- Added user flag "n" which can be used to disallow someone
  the right to give oer commands (for instance this can be
  used with bots to prevent missuse through those bots with
  a say command)
- Fixed some issues with vhost
- Added del vhost command
- Fixed a major problem with mmodes and timeds (mmodes/timeds
  could just vanish without being executed, Thanks must go to
  Mauri Kinnunen)
- oer will from now on strip mIRC colors and control characters
  when parsing a channel topic
- The "reset" command introduced in -58 broke del adverts,
  del nickbks, del permbans and del wordbks (fixed)
- Permbans weren't removed from the channel when they were
  removed with the "reset" command, fixed
- Signals were broken on newer Solaris versions (and have
  been for a long time), fixed
- Added support for signal SIGUSR1 which can be used to
  increase the level of debugging (0..max and max->0)
- Implemented a force flush to disk every x rows, set
  OER_FORCE_FLUSH in oer-common.h to the value you want (if
  you want immediate updates you would set it to 1)
- If oer couldn't join a channel because of IRC server error
  439, oer will now retry joining the channel in question
  after the amount of seconds specified by the IRC server have
  elapsed
- Did some tweaking to oer version and copyright strings
- Increased the length of ext's message part, it can now be
  432 bytes in length assuming the IRC server will accept it

1.0-58
------

- It was possible to add a flag multiple times with one
  command, fixed (eg. edit chanflags oooooo)
- If a channel had force-topic set (chanflag "t") and Q
  was on channel with forcetopic, it would lead to a
  battle, fixed (Q is allowed if q friendly mode is set
  or q is set as a service)
- If you set any of the banvars to 0, the ban in question
  won't be set (if for example you don't want your users
  to be banned for swearing set the bad word banvar to 0)
- Did some autoconf/Makefile tweaking
- The destination directory where oer and it's configs get
  installed can be specified in "make install" again (bad
  move, I was too busy to fix it properly)
- list handles will now go through global admins also
- Added functionality for external information to be
  displayed through oer, see the online help for command
  "ext" (ext has also "s" chanflag support)
- When validating any of the flags oer didn't clear the
  destination buffer which could lead to some problems on
  some platforms, fixed
- Updated CYGWIN
- Updated BUGREPORTING (added a section for you lazy people)
- Added "reset" command (see Online Help)

1.0-57
------

- Added support for chanmodes +c/+C (a QuakeNet extension)
- Forced logoff broke in -56, fixed
- If changing a dynamic user to a static one, oer will
  from now on logoff the user automatically
- Updated HELP
- Manual logoff didn't work if channel had chanflag "x", fixed
- Added '+' and '!' to allowed channel prefixes (RFC 2811)

1.0-56
------

- Localized pattern matching, if you have some weird oer
  behaviour (bankicking even if there is not a exact wordbk
  match etc), I suggest you test out this version
- If a channel has the "G" chanflag set and a opped non-admin
  user triggers the flood protection, the user is now deopped
  first then banned (and kicked in case of repeat flood)
- "del mask admin" reports now correctly the handle and mask
- Updated HELP
- wordbk's support now also exact matches (single words)
- edit password can no longer be sent to a channel
- Added a timeout to the registration phase (timeout is 10
  minutes after which oer will connect to the next server)
- You can no longer change the destination directory with
  "make install", use configure from now on
- For obvious reasons " can no longer be used as a prefix
- The last command now encloses messages in "
- oer no longer permits a user from channel A to use oer's
  commands which require no channel parameter on channel B
  (the only problem with the old behaviour was that a user
  from channel A could flood channel B using oer)
- Internal dynamic admin (global flag "d") wasn't deleted
  when disconnecting from a server, fixed
- Added a priority class for adverts, oer should no longer
  cause excess flood with many (more than 30) small (less
  than 50 characters) adverts
- Rewrote the way wordbk's are handled, from now on words
  said by someone will be parsed word by word, not by sentence
  (IMO, it makes more sense this way)
- oer didn't notice if it was kicked by a service, fixed
- Fixed yet another nick change bug
- I tested this version of oer with muh 2.05d (a opensource
  IRC bouncer http://mind.riot.org/muh) and it seems to
  work, just remember to set the bouncer password as a server
  password
- In flood protection the +o/+v was given back before the ban
  was removed, fixed
- Changed "add channel" so that it takes now only one channel
  and optionally chanflags (this way you can add inactive
  channels and have oer not join them)
- Basic support for a telnet proxy (specify the proxy string
  in "make install" or use "edit proxysetup" while oer is
  running)
- Forced logons didn't work anymore with /msg, fixed
- There were also some other issues with autheds, fixed
- The channel modes weren't set on a channel created with
  clonechannel, fixed
- After a logoff no channel sync was done, fixed

1.0-55
------

- On startup oer will no longer join all channels in parallel,
  it will from now on wait until it has actually joined the
  channel before joining another one (should cause less flood
  if there are more than 10 channels to join)
- If get'n'keep (global flag "g") nick is set, oer will no longer
  attempt to get it's primary nick until it has joined all it's
  channels (in some rare circumstances oer would get confused
  about it's nick)
- I made a typo in -54 that broke autheds for dynamic admins and
  channels without "x", fixed
- Only global admins could force a logon, fixed
- Fixed requestop rule #1 (nicks 4 -> 5) and furthermore channels
  with more than 20 users are no longer automatically handled

1.0-54
------

- Changed CTCP replies to a lower priority, it should now be
  safer to set the global flag "f"
- Added chanflag "X" to disallow using of action and say by
  non admins
- Flush and save now require at least channel admin privileges
- If a dynamic admin or a user is deleted also autheds of that
  admin or user (handle) must be deleted, fixed
- There were several bugs relating to autheds and to the use
  of the "x" chanflag, should be fixed now (Thanks must go to
  Emperor| and QuakeNet's #Joensuu)
- Changed the way list channels works, from now on channels
  that have a key, are secret or are hidden aren't shown if
  the command was sent to a channel (if the command is sent
  to oer with /msg authorization checking will be done)
- list channels also now shows if oer has +o on the channel
- Quit, massmessage and raw commands all dropped the first
  parameter if it was a valid IRC channel, fixed
- saveconf() falsely stripped CONNECTION_STATE_PREFIX from
  the live user value, fixed
- getserver() always scanned from top of the server list not
  from the current server if one was set, fixed
- requestop will now request op from O immediatly after joining
  a opless channel or right after the channel becomes opless
  (until now oer would wait 300 seconds)
- A dynamic admin can no longer be changed into a static one or
  visa versa (use add admin)
- Global admins without +o would be given +v on each sync, fixed

1.0-53
------

- Cosmetic: increased the string buffer in parsemsg() to get
  rid of the annoying parse error ("..buffer too small..")
- Added support for QuakeNet's requestop feature, set chanflag
  "R" to activate it (see QuakeNet's guide for more information)
- oer would falsely attempt to re-op users if chanflag "D" was
  set but oer wasn't opped itself, fixed
- if setlocale() failed carbage would be displayed, fixed
- lock would sometimes kick before +i was set, fixed
- lock would sometimes choose a nick that was already flagged
  for kicking, fixed (could be a problem on lagged servers)
- list servers listed all servers as current, fixed
- A inactive channel admin (user with "!" and "a" flags) is no
  longer allowed to change own flags
- Added a "cycle" command (useful to force oer to leave & join
  a channel and in doing so reseting some internal variables)
- locku didn't automatically unlock the channel after the last
  user to be kicked was kicked, fixed
- There was a bug in the get & keep nick feature which would
  result in oer doing userhost queries for itself endlessly
  (the bug was quite hard to trigger though), fixed
- Added bstats command for reporting some bot statistics

1.0-52
------

- Made some code optimizations
- The alternative or a random nick was falsely saved into the
  config file as primary nick, fixed
- Added a internal dynamic admin feature (global flag "d")
  which allows you to control oer from oer's userhost
  (userhost is always user@host meaning ident + hostname)
- Added usercopy command which allows you to copy users
  within a channel or to another channel
- Added edit server (you can change settings of the current
  IRC server)
- edit options admin allowed non protected admins to make
  themselves/other admins protected, fixed
- oer will now check that flags given to add, del or edit
  are valid
- global flags wasn't sorted if altered with edit flags
- Channel flag "x" had broken dynamic users/admins, fixed
- Command prefix and nick couldn't be the same, fixed
- Wrote support for channelbans (automatic detection,
  listing and clearing of them)
- Updated all (C) strings to contain year 2002
- In order to keep oer and oer+MySQL consistent (the initial
  requirement was to fix a fatal oer+MySQL bug), parts of
  the authentication code had to be rewritten
- Some cosmetic fixes relating to clearing of variables
- list channels showed +p channels and channel keys to
  everyone, fixed
- Rewrote oer's channel flood protection routines

1.0-51
------

- oer will now only fallback to making USERHOST
  queries, a WHO query is done on channel join
- made some code cleanup relating to processenv()
- oer will now write a signoff message in case it detects
  a stoned server (if you see a "stoned server" signoff
  message, it probably means that the ping frequency in the
  server setting is too small, you need to increase it)
- Fixed chanflag "U" for last, seen, quote, and nstats
- Added global flag "p" to tell oer not to check for
  a stoned server (some networks seem to have disabled the
  defacto standard PING-PONG feature)
- Fixed several issues with chanmode, chankey and
  chanlimit (Thanks Renzo)
- There was a very hard to find bug in multiple mode
  processing that was introduced in -41, the bug would cause
  unbans etc. not to be scheduled, fixed (Thanks Renzo,
  Emperor| and Azo)

1.0-50
------

- Fixed a potential crash when changing nicks, this bug was
  introduced in -48 (Thanks Renzo)
- Updated BUGREPORTING
- There was a lurking bug in the message parsing, fixed (oer
  would obey to commands even if there wasn't a whitespace
  delimiting the prefix or nick name of oer and the command)
- add/del/edit chanflags was missing a channel sync, fixed
- Improved security for "list adverts" (when sent to a
  channel, oer will check that there are no users that
  shouldn't see the advert, if there are the advert won't
  be shown)
- Added chanflag "c" to disallow ACTIONS on channel

1.0-49
------

- Fixed initial flooding of the console by processactions()
  in debug mode
- Decreased the default PRIVMSG/NOTICE barrier in
  processactions() by one second
- Changed oer not to quote messages with "(c)"

- Added a date command
- Added the "V" chanflag (auto voice admins on join)
- Removed the "(truncated)" from last command, as many
  characters as possible is displayed from now on
- Added a UPGRADING text file describing what usually
  needs to be done when upgrading from version to version
- Made on-join quoting return better quotes
- Fixed some Solaris/SunOS specific bugs, debug-mode
  should work again on those platforms
- oer did not work with local channels, fixed (&unix)
- Logons that are expired are now correctly detected as
  soon as they expire
- If oer is given a erroneus altnick and the primary nick
  is taken, oer will use a random nick
- Added channel flag "x" to tell oer not to timeout logons
- oer will now write a file called oer.pid that will
  contain the process id of oer (no further copies of oer
  are started if this file exists and a process having
  the pid in oer.pid is running and is owned by the user
  trying to start oer)
- Added tools/checkoer.sh to be put in crontab for you
  people out their having unreliable UNIX shells
- There is now a check when backuping configuration files
  that the file being backed up hasn't got zero size
  (with this change having "b" flag one should assure that
  there is at least one working set of configs in   case of
  quota/diskspace filling up)
- If channel has "O" or "V" flags, dynamic admins are now
  automatically opped or voiced on logon
- Added chanlimit (works just like chankey)
- You can run oer on Windows with Cygwin, the procedure is
  explained in CYGWIN

1.0-48
------

- Fixed a memory leak in cleanautheds()
- oer would keep on setting the chanmode(s) on networks
  which allow re-setting of channel modes, fixed
- There were several issues with the "g" flag introduced
  in -47, I hope I found them all
- Rewrote the server registration bits
- Fixed add nickbk/wordbk
- Unified permbans with nickbks and wordbks (redo bans)
- Changed all occurances of "lamer(s)" to "normal(s)"
- Topic separator is now a #define in oer-common.h
- Changed channelsync not to op/voice if channel doesn't
  have "o"/"v" flag set
- Added support for dynamic voice
- Added chanflag "s" as in "serve all" (with this flag
  you can allow anyone on channel to use the following
  commands: help, info, uptime, sstats, last, quote,
  seen and nstats -- THINK BEFORE you set this flag, it
  will allow anyone to cause flood to oer and the channel)
- Fixed error checking for getondiskmsgcount() in parse.c 
- Minor tweaking to Makefile
- There were a few places where a open file handle
  wouldn't get closed, fixed
- Added support for the remaining IRCNet user ID prefixes
- If logging was switched on after starting oer the log
  would be named oer-<pid>.log where as if logging was on
  when oer was started the log was named oer-<pid>.raw
  (now the latter is used in both cases)
- On-join and manual quoting, last, seen and nstats didn't
  work if last/seen logging wasn't enabled, they will now
- add and del flags was broken for "l", fixed
- Rewrote the command scheduling logic (and due to this
  rewrital the wall command amongst others has been changed)
- Not all CTCP's sent to a channel were checked for flood
- Implemented nick flood protection (chanflag "k", also see
  the Online Help for the 2 new parameters to floodvars)
- Fixed the MAX CHANNEL detection (oer will now try to
  rejoin a channel it couldn't join because of the maximum
  channel limit)
- Bogus chanmodes were sometimes set when oer was opped and
  there were unset chanmodes (or a chankey)
- There was a bug when syncing permbans, fixed
- oer no longer stops parsing the configuration files if it
  encounters a unparseable line

1.0-47
------

- Fixed add user to allow adding users without flags
- last and seen were broken for a nick that had no records
- There was a lurking bug in channel mode detection
- The last and seen logs were falsely opened in clonechannel()
- A response resulting from the deletion of a channel
  wasn't sent to the channel being deleted, fixed
- Deleting permbans didn't work as expected, fixed
- oer had problems parsing lines with very long words
- One couldn't add a channel key if no channel modes had
  been set, fixed
- List flags now works the same way list chanflags does
- Implemented add & del flags (works just like chanflags)
- Sample kickreasons weren't copied over to the install
  directory, fixed
- Added global flag "b" (switch it on if you want oer to
  make a backup of the configuration files when they are
  being saved)
- Added some additional checks to configuration saving
- Added global flag "g" meaning get & keep nick (oer will
  register itself on the server with a alternative or a
  random nick but will keep on trying to get it's primary
  nick as long as necessary, works also "on the fly")
- Added chanflag "t" to indicate you want a topic lock
  (all topic changes should go through oer)
- On disconnect from the server not all of the internal
  parameters were being reset, fixed
- Added support for Q auth, see the Online Help for the
  syntax (NOTICE! your Q password will be stored in plain
  text, so extreme care should be taken)
- The channel mode wasn't being set on rejoin, fixed
- There was a longstanding bug where oer wouldn't respond
  to some commands from a global admin if no channels had
  yet been defined
- "make install" allows now adding of dynamic global admins
- Unified a bit the way nickbks and wordbks are being handled
  in oer and oer+MySQL (you might want to reset your nickbks
  and wordbks to get working kick reasons)
- Fixed some minor memory leaks
- Correct handling of the restricted connection indicator '^'
- Added channel flag "N" to indicate that oer should
  consider only bot users with "o" as channel operators
  (can be used together with "U" to make oer see channel
  operators without user records as normal users)
- Fixed oer from flooding itself with USERHOST queries on
  channels with hundreds of users
- Fixed list nicks to not cause excess flood on channels
  with hundreds of users
- Fixed "make install" for shells not providing a system
  wide install command
- IRC REALNAME didn't allow >1 words, fixed
- Changed the way "lamers" are being picked on random ban,
  random ban & kick and lock
- Removed the notice that one shouldn't remove oer's permbans

1.0-46
------

- Added support for global admin passwords (works just
  like with channel users, just obmit the channel)
- NOTICE! Because of the above change you will have to
  go through your configuration before running oer
  and see that no admin (in oer.admins) has the "d" 
  flag set, otherwise you will be unable to admin
  oer because the admin has no password
- Fixed a subtle bug when processing multiple modes
- checkstoned will no longer be processed on startup
- Fixed add server so that it really requires just the
  hostname & port, other parameters are optional
- Fixed add admin to allow adding admins without flags
- There was another lurking bug in the authorization
  checking, fixed
- List chanflags verbose no longer fitted in to one
  server message, fixed

1.0-45
------

- Fixed uptime command for non /proc systems
- Userhosts were being queried too fast on channel join
- Rewrote code where floating point math was used
- Added channel flag "M" and user flag "m" to prevent
  normal users from adding, removing or changing their
  hostmasks
- oer didn't check for the "l" chanflag when the lock
  command was issued by a non-admin user
- Fixed also other issues with the lock command

1.0-44
------

- Fixed the op and deop commands
- When adding a new service trusteds were falsely scanned
  for existance, fixed
- Trusted and services (hosts) can now have wildcards
- Fixed the order of KICK and MODE in !bk and !rbk
- Fixed yet some MODE bugs (these all were introduced
  in -42 when I changed the size of NICKLEN)
- Fixed list channels to hide only +p & +s channels if
  the user requesting the list isn't at least op on the
  channel being listed
- Made the oer main loop process actions even after
  server I/O, should speed things up (not too much I hope)
- Changed NICKLEN from 15 to 20

1.0-43
------

- syncops() had a incorrect authorization check, fixed
- The order of KICK and MODE in ban & kick was also fixed
- When cycling a channel to gain ops the wait period
  between rejoins was decreased from 10 to 1 second
- Improved "make install"
- Fixed the automatic synchronization that was called when
  oer was opped

- Fixed the "not a prototype" warnings for oer.c on Solaris

1.0-42
------

- Support for !del channel without parameter(s) was removed
- Added multiple parameter support for many commands,
  see the Online help (marked with []...)
- Changed NICKLEN, USERLEN, HOSTLEN and USERHOSTLEN to
  more realistic values (as reference I used Linux and
  the Undernet derived ircu, if you need to increase
  these to suit your needs, edit oer-common.h)
- Decreased the wall delay from 5 to 2 seconds
- When chanflags L or S are set, added or deleted a more
  informative message is displayed
- Listing autheds always listed all hostmasks for a authed
  handle, added support for start position

1.0-41
------

- Did some code cleanup based on profiling information
- Added an additional check to clonechannel()
- Added a BUGREPORTING file that contains instructions
  on how to send comprehensive bug reports
- Implemented add & del chanflags (you just give the
  flags you want to set or remove, not all of them)
- Changed del channel command so that it allows you to
  specify which channel to delete when sending the
  command to the channel
- Added devoice command
- Restored multiple modes
- Added support for services, this works just like
  the Q friendly mode except you can have several hosts
  (the global flag for services is "s")
- Rewrote processenv() and some related functions
- Backported pre_install.sh from oer+MySQL (allows you
  to make your initial configuration in "make install")
- Did some additional code cleanup
- The default for oer is now to have no debug messages,
  you will have to specify --enable-debug to configure
  if you want the messages (the size reduction of the
  optimized & striped binary vs. the binary with debug
  messages & symbols is about 70%)
- Added a TODO file (always first look at the TODO
  before suggesting anew feature)
- Added global flag "m" to make oer send messages
  instead of notices (not preferred)
- Added a validity check when adding new channels
- Fixed a bug in authorization checking (for example
  if you had a "dfv" user with *@* and a bunch of
  "o" users with their respective masks, the *@* mask
  would get matched for the "o" users)
- There was a memory leak when deleting a user with
  a password or removing the "d" flag from a user, fixed
- Changed the way list chanflags works: you will from
  now on have to specify "verbose" as a argument to
  list chanflags if you want the verbose listing
- Implemented server statistics (sstats)
- The stoned server checking was obviously broken and
  has always been (now only activity from server is
  counted as activity -- you may have to change your
  server ping frequencies to something more realistic,
  see /trace <nick> for the server class then see
  /stats y to see the respective Y: line, the ping
  frequency is the 2nd parameter for the Y:line)

1.0-40
------

- Did some code cleanup to avoid compiler warnings
- Added channel flag "D" to enable de-op protection of
  bot users with at least "o" flag
- Made linenoise to be a value from MIN..pingfreq (you
  will have to increase the value from 1 to something
  sensible like 10-30 if you don't want Excess Flood)
- Fixed the issue with ~ in ident (oer no longer saves
  the ~ to the user ident, it will always be prefixed by
  the server if no ident response is received)
- Rewrote completely the scheduling of IRC commands to
  be priority then time based (since this is the most
  important part of oer, it will require a lot of testing
  by you the users to find out all the possible problems)
- Bumped up the amount of actions processed per loop from
  1 to 2 (if you get Excess Floods, set the variable
  OER_ACTIONS_PER_MAINLOOP in oer-common.h to 1)
- If the configured bantype can't be set (because
  of trusted domains or conflicting hostmask with oer)
  oer will now also try other ban types
- Added a THANKS file that contains a list (not 100%
  accurate, sorry!) of people that have in some way
  contributed in the development and/or testing of oer
- Added clonechannel command
- Made the combination of "d" and "f" user flags work

1.0-39
------

- Fixed a longstanding bug where oer would take user@host
  from the server as it's hostname instead of just the host
- oer will now also use the user id returned by the server
  instead of using the one in the config
- Added a bantype setting for channels, see online help
- Added a "all" and a "user@host" type to adverts
- vhost flag wasn't set on edit vhost, fixed
- Changed some memory allocations and de-allocations from
  static to dynamic. The change should save up some memory
  (the more users your bot has, the more memory is saved
  by these changes)
- Did some code cleanup
- oer incorrectly tried joining a channel waiting
  OER_AUTO_REJOIN_TIME seconds in between joins (the
  correct one is OER_DELAY_BETWEEN_REJOINS
- Added --enable-profile to configure (enable this to get
  profiling information which you can study with prof/gprof)
- Decreased the default net join period from 30 to 15 seconds
- last & seen will now accept a second argument specifying
  how many entries to list (1..MAX)

1.0-38
------

- The inactivity flag is now also displayed in list users
- Fixed the time.h detection (especially Debian users
  suffered from this oversight)
- Channel admins can no longer add the "a" flag to other
  users making them channel admins
- List channels will now also list user count
- Added edit usermode, edit user and edit vhost
- All edit commands should now send a response
- Unified a bit the logic how responses are sent on add,
  edit, del and list commands

1.0-37
------

- Fixed segmentation faults that were triggered on
  platforms lacking snprintf() if empty server
  passwords were passed to parseconf()
- Brought Copyright strings up to date
- Added support for ERR_UNAVAILRESOURCE (meaning if
  oer received ERR_UNAVAILRESOURCE from server because
  of netsplit or such, oer would fail)
- In addition to the set prefix oer will also now obey
  commands prefixed with it's active nick

1.0-36
------

- Added chanflag "G" to indicate that everyone is checked
  for public flood (except service & admins)
- Now the chanflags T, ! and U are also displayed

1.0-35
------

- There was a strlen() after a free in snprintf()
- If no server password was specified, garbage could
  be displayed
- Added chanflag "T" to indicate that oer should not
  do topic handling for the channel
- Added chanflag "!" to indicate that the channel is
  inactive and should not be joined
- Added chanflag "U" to indicate that only users on
  bot (with +a or +o) are allowed to use oer
 
1.0-34
------

- Fixed a subtle bug in processtimeds() that could
  lead into bogus kick/ban reasons (it was a quite
  small window, >= 2 timeds in one second before
  processenv() was ever called)
- Fixed safeban() to correctly return ident@host bans
- Fixed the random kick reason
- Added initial support for server passwords (last field
  of server line, optional)

1.0-33
------

- A syncbans() was missing in del permban and
  in parseirc
- Added "list handles" to get handle(s) for a specific
  nick on a channel (eg. handles with matching hostmasks)
- Made a quick locale fix to allow a wider spectrum of
  acceptable characters for the c-lib functions such as
  isprint() etc -- See "man locale" on how to set locale
  before running oer (most Linux users running a fresh
  Linux distribution should be fine)

1.0-32
------

- Got rid of list.c/list.h (obsolete debugging functions)
- Cleaned up Makefile
- uptime() was missing a fclose()
- Removed a memory leak in initparts()
- Fixed several hostname related issues (there are
  unfortunately some left)
- Changed lastoff() to also look at the hostname
- oer command prefix can now be upto 16 chars
- list channels was missing
- oer didn't handle unset channel modes, fixed

1.0-31
------

- Changed the way nick/altnick is handled and added support
  for a random nick (you'll have to change it manually once
  the primary/secondary nick is available)
- Added !list and !edit altnick because of the above change
- Added inactivity user flag "!" (channel admins can set/
  remove for users and admins for channel admins)
- Added channel adverts (set flag "A" to enable these, see
  add/del/list commands for advert specifics)
- Added support for FreeBSD (a kludge for now until I have
  some more time to find out what is wrong with FreeBSD)

1.0-30
------

- Added paranoid channel flag "P" (combined with "u" flag
  all dyn-ops are required to have valid logons to remain/get opped)
- Fixed admin logon (2nd parameter is now the hostmask you wish to
  get authed for the given handle)
- Increased oer's channel rejoin delay from 3 to 10 seconds
- Made !locku (new, automatically unlocked) and !lock accept
  a reason for the channel lock (optional)

1.0-29
------

- Fixed yet again a "banned for x minutes"
- Fixed getserver() not to get stuck if only one
  IRC server was in server list
- Added !rbk
- If there were bogus/lagged server/service KICK messages,
  oer would segfault (Q for example caused them, sorry for
  this one, I will be looking closely at re-writing the
  channel routines)

1.0-28
------

- Changed oer to correctly show the ban length on auto rejoin
- Added flag "f" to make oer respond to ctcp queries from anyone
- Added "q" flag, a Q-bot friendly mode
- Added chanflag "O" for auto-opping admins even if not a chan user
- Added some additional checks for server modes

1.0-27
------

- Removed a few duplicate linefeeds
- Added support to oer's parse() for non-fixed delimiters
  (eg. you can have >1 spaces between parameters of
  your /msg commands)
- NOTICE! There was a oversight in password-encrypting,
  which was fixed (this means that all passwords have
  to be reset with edit password once the -27 version
  is running)

1.0-26
------

- A isme() check was missing when checking if someone
  altered chanmodes (would cause oer to begin setting
  chanmodes and never stop)
- oer should now compile & run on NetBSD (1.2G tested)
- I have written 3 scripts for managing oer's seen/last
  log files: checklog.pl, fixlog.pl and logstrip.pl (the
  scripts are in the tools sub-directory)
- Made some informative messages less verbose
- Added banvars (just like floodvars, see help for details)
- Changed list channels to display channel key if one is set
- chanflags are now alphabetically sorted in list chanflags
- Made showing of the server idle percentage in the uptime
  command optional (define OER_UPTIME_SHOW_IDLE in
  oer-common.h if you wish it to be shown)

1.0-25
------

- Normal users couldn't use non-channel specific list
  commands with /msg (also /msg save & /msg flush
  suffered from this oversight)
- Improved system/environment checks in configure.in
- oer should now compile & run on IRIX (6.5 tested)

1.0-24
------

- First public release
