Step 1
------

  "./configure"

You can specify the destination dir with --prefix. It defaults to
$HOME/oer. You can also specify --enable-debug to switch on debugging
symbols. Specify --disable-opt to de-activate optimization. Also,
specify --enable-profile if you want to enable profiling in the oer
binary.

Step 2
------

  "make"

Step 3
------

  "make install"

You will be prompted for some essential settings which oer needs to
run. After you have answered all the questions the oer binary and the
generated configuration files are placed in the directory specified by
--prefix (defaults to $HOME/oer)

After installing, if you want you can remove the oer-dist directory.
