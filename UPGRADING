- Always read the attached CHANGELOG for any important changes between
  versions. If any of the oer file formats changes, you are possibly
  prompted to take some action. The CHANGELOG will always list these
  actions.

- Invoke "make install" and answer "n" when prompted if you wish to
  create the initial configuration for oer

- "make install" will simply place the new oer binary to the
  destination directory. You could also copy the "oer" binary over.

- You are done.
