You want to run oer on Windows? With Cygwin you can. Since there isn't
a Cygwin version of MySQL, you can only run the plain oer version for
now.  Cygwin is a GNU/UNIX emulator for Windows. Here is how you can
get oer running with Cygwin:

- Download Cygwin from the Cygwin site http://cygwin.com/setup.exe

- Run setup.exe

- Flag under "Devel" the following packages (only BIN required)
	* autoconf
	* gcc
	* make

- Flag under "Libs" the following packages (only BIN required)
	* crypt

- Proceed to install

- Download the newest oer archive (oer-1.0-xx.tar.gz) and place it
  into your Cygwin home dir (for example C:\Cygwin\home\Administrator)

- Start Cygwin: Start->Programs->Cygwin->Cygwin Bash Shell

- Ungzip & untar the oer archive with: "tar xvzf oer-1.0-xx.tar.gz"

- Go to the oer-dist dir by writing "cd oer-dist"

- For the remaining installation steps see INSTALL in oer-dist
